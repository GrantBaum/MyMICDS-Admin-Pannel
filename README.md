A fresh new repository for a MyMICDS Admin Pannel, implemented in HTML and Vanilla js. I would appreciate if you made pull requests and dont just put everything in master, even if you have permissions. It just helps me keep track of changes. Thanks!
Here are the goals for this project:
1. Easily viewing and moderating user's background images
2. Managing MyMICDS Notes OneNote and OneDrive API tokens
3. Possibly make it easier to put the announcements on the site by making them editable here
4. runtime statistics
5. ping/speed etc.
6. blacklisting certain days we know the portal is broken
7. Taking over the world
8. Other things we will think of later

#####I want this webiste to be really passive agressive. If you have any ideas on how to enhance that, please let me know.
